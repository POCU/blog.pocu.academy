                    <p>Hello, POCU Academy students! This is Yoona!</p>
<p>Today's success story features game engine programmer Alegruz. Our POCU students really don't waste time—graduating from university and <em>immediately</em> smashing job offers left and right! Truly the pride of POCU. #POCUForever</p>
<p>And on top of that, he landed a job at Pearl Abyss, the studio behind the famous titles <em>Black Desert</em> and <em>DokeV</em>. Without further delay, let's dive into his story!</p>
<p><img src="/ko/assets/img/20230214/pearl-abbyss-logo.png" alt="Pearl Abyss Logo" /></p>

<h4>Hello! I'm today's interviewer, Yoona. Could you start by briefly introducing yourself?</h4>
<p>Hello. I graduated this year (2022) with a major in Software Engineering, and starting next year (2023), I'll be working as a Game Engine Programmer at Pearl Abyss. My handle is &quot;Alegruz.&quot;</p>
<h4>Amazing. Congratulations! So what kind of work are you doing right now?</h4>
<p>Uh... I apologize, but since my official start date hasn't arrived yet, I can't say I've <em>actually</em> begun working. But broadly speaking, I'll be joining as a junior developer on the Black Space engine, Pearl Abyss's next-generation in-house engine that will power their future projects.</p>
<h4>What made you interested in programming? How did you get started?</h4>
<p>I've always loved creating things—music, writing novels, shooting videos... even architecture has started to interest me lately. Games bring all of those creative elements together <em>and</em> add fun on top, so naturally I became fascinated with them.</p>
<p>But I didn't start programming early. As an elementary schooler, I designed RPG systems in notebooks using MapleStory's item data, or created maps using the StarCraft editor.
In middle school, I made game music and created games with GameMaker, though its scripting language was too hard for me at the time, so I stuck to visual scripting.
In high school, academics took over, so the only &quot;game-related&quot; thing I did was write a mini-thesis about games.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/UProw1LhcgY?t=60">Game made while high on creativity: Daedoseogwan's Let's Play – &quot;Our Kitty Has a Disability!&quot;</a><br />
<em>My unofficial &quot;industry debut&quot;: Our Kitty Has a Disability!</em></p>
<p>If I think back to middle school, I used to collaborate online with different people on hobby game projects. I admired the programmers so much that it naturally pushed me toward Computer Engineering in high school. That led to entering university as a Software major, and I learned my first programming language there: Python.</p>
<h4>Oh wow, that's more structured than I expected. How did you discover POCU Academy?</h4>
<p>I started watching <em>Pope Kim's</em> YouTube videos back in high school. I followed his updates pretty closely. After entering university, I even thought, &quot;Wow... imagine if this monster taught at my school.&quot; LOL. Later, when I was in the military, I learned through YouTube that Pope was launching POCU Academy.</p>
<h4>Your POCU fandom is strong! What courses did you take?</h4>
<ul>
<li>C++ Unmanaged Programming</li>
<li>Object-Oriented Programming &amp; Design</li>
<li>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</li>
</ul>
<h4>Did you have any expectations before taking the courses? And did they meet those expectations?</h4>
<p>Honestly, I didn't have expectations. Expectations are like assuming something specific will be given to you, right? Instead, I approached the courses like getting on a rollercoaster—<em>just let it take me wherever it wants.</em> Rather than setting an upper limit, I wondered, &quot;How high can this course take me?&quot; And that's exactly the feeling I got, especially with the first course: C++ Unmanaged Programming.</p>
<h4>Cool mindset! That said, were there any difficulties or things you wished were better?</h4>
<p>Well... yes, all three courses were difficult... T_T As for downsides... I'm not sure if I should say this, but from a student's perspective: the cost is killer. Also, I think beginners would appreciate a bit more guidance or simple concrete examples on debugging and testing.</p>
<p>Another thing... I'm heading into full-time work soon, so I worry I won't have time to take more POCU courses... yet assembly class got delayed...? (Half joke, half truth LOL)</p>
<h4>Noted... ahem. After completing your POCU courses, what changes did you experience? Career or mindset—anything is fine.</h4>
<p>When I took C++ Unmanaged Programming, I was still a soldier. After finishing it, I got discharged and immediately returned to school. That semester, I took a Data Structures course at university—and it felt <em>way too easy</em>. Even the exercises felt basic compared to POCU. It was surreal.</p>
<p>Curious about my skill level, I applied for game company internships and entry-level positions.
I got rejected from all internships (probably because I was only a 2nd-year). But strangely, I passed the first round for a Nexon-affiliated studio as a full-time applicant and received a coding assignment. The assignment was extremely difficult—stuff I'd never done before—so I completed only about 60%. I thought it was over. But then they contacted me saying I passed and invited me for an interview. The 1st interview was technical; I solved problems calmly, assuming I wouldn't pass anyway.   ones I solved were entirely based on what I learned at POCU. Then the 2nd interview came—with several intimidating 40-something directors. In the end, I didn't pass final selection.</p>
<p>But honestly, I never expected to even <em>reach</em> the final interview. POCU's C++ course had clearly leveled me up beyond what I realized. That's when I became certain:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;POCU Academy's courses can be trusted. Just follow them.&quot;</strong><br />
#POCUForever2</p>
<p>Beyond programming skill, POCU taught me confidence. By my 4th year, I didn't prepare on LeetCode. I'd done POCU and studied core CS at school—I felt prepared.</p>
<p>And in the end, I passed the recruitment-linked internship at Pearl Abyss as a game engine programmer, and that led to a full-time offer. I never solved a single LeetCode problem, and still got a full-time job before graduation.</p>
<h4>Thank you for sharing! Any advice for future POCU students (&quot;POCUlers&quot;)?</h4>
<p>Let's talk money first.</p>
<p>Is it worth it?<br />
Yes. Without a doubt.</p>
<p>You may feel the video lectures alone are expensive. They <em>are</em>. But they're worth the value. However, it's not a small investment—so taking these courses casually or without preparation is a waste.</p>
<h4>Any tech fields you're currently interested in that you'd like to share?</h4>
<p>I'm very into the series of techniques that originated from ReSTIR in the Real-Time Path Tracing area:</p>
<p>ReSTIR, ReSTIR GI, RTXDI, World-Space ReSTIR, Volumetric ReSTIR, GRIS (ReSTIR PT), Resampled DDGI, and so on.</p>
<h4>What are your future plans? Any goals as a game engine programmer?</h4>
<p>I want to build a custom engine that can be used as:</p>
<ul>
<li>course material</li>
<li>lab exercise framework</li>
<li>team project tool<br />
at my alma mater.</li>
</ul>
<p>If such an engine were built by alumni who actually work in the industry, I think it would help produce even stronger developers from the school.</p>
<h4>Your loyalty to your alma mater is admirable. Lastly, any final message?</h4>
<p>POCU Academy's first course is COMP0000, the beginner course. That's important, but here's my personal belief:</p>
<p>The real first step to becoming a developer is English. LOL</p>
<p>Don't slack on your English studies! You'll absolutely need it.</p>
